Vectors were used instead of an array or multi-dimensional array.  
They were new to me and seemed to make sense, though things got confusing at times.

To Do: 📃  
* Streamline user input conversion logic (is there a toupper function? switch-case might be helpful in other parts)  
* Streamline how program determines wins (perhaps a loop to check after each input)
* Clean up code formatting
